# Machine Learning: Census Income Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Machine Learning project to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census data. The project uses Naïve Bayes and Random Forest classifiers to solve the classification problem and compares their performance using various evaluation metrics.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
1. Create a dataset suitable for machine learning through data and feature engineering.
2. Compare and contrast supervised machine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes and Random Forest) using optimal evaluation metrics.
3. Demonstrate the use of a machine learning framework for model implementation and evaluation.

## Dataset Description

### Source
The dataset, *Census Income*, is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
Link: [Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)

### Features
The dataset contains 14 attributes, including demographic and employment-related features, such as:
- Age
- Workclass
- Education
- Marital status
- Occupation
- Hours per week

The target variable is:
- **Income**: `<=50K` or `>50K`

## Models Used
1. **Naïve Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic model suitable for categorical data.
2. **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust ensemble learning method for better accuracy and handling of feature importance.
